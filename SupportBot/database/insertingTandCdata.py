However, Lawyer Desk may assign this Agreement without User’s consent to any entity that acquires all or substantially all of the business or assets of Lawyer Desk related to the Services, whether by merger, reorganization, acquisition, sale, operation of law, change in control, or otherwise. Any assignment made in conflict with this provision shall be void. These Terms are binding upon and will inure to the benefits of each of the parties and their respective successors and assigns. Nothing in these Terms is intended or shall be construed to give any person, other than the parties hereto, their successors, and permitted assigns, any legal or equitable right, remedy, or claim under or in respect to these Terms.\n\nD. Waiver\nNo failure or delay by either party in exercising any right under these Terms shall constitute a waiver of that right unless expressly acknowledged and agreed to by both parties in writing.

In the case of any conflict or inconsistency between the provisions of your Subscription Agreement and the provisions of these Terms, these Terms shall govern.\n\nF. Governing Law and Jurisdiction\nYou agree that: (i) the Services shall be deemed solely based in India; and (ii) the Services shall be deemed a passive one that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over Lawyer Desk, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than India. These Terms shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of India, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences with respect to the substantive law, any arbitration conducted pursuant to these Terms shall be governed by the Indian Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts located in India for any actions for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, as set forth in the arbitration provision below, including any provisional relief required to prevent irreparable harm. You agree that Hyderabad, India is the proper forum for any appeals of an arbitration award or for trial court proceedings in the event that the arbitration provision below is found to be unenforceable.\n\nG. Arbitration\nREAD THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THE PARTIES TO ARBITRATE THEIR DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US. This Section 13(G) (the “Arbitration Agreement”) This provision governs any dispute, controversy, or claim between you and us, whether directly or indirectly related to: (a) these Terms, covering aspects such as their formation, existence, breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, validity, or enforceability; (b) access to or use of the Services, encompassing the receipt of any advertising, marketing, or other communications from us; (c) any transactions conducted through, by, or using the Services; or (d) any other aspect of your relationship or transactions with us, whether directly or indirectly, as a user or consumer (\"Claim\" or collectively, \"Claims\"). The Arbitration Agreement applies to all Claims, irrespective of whether they arose or were asserted before or after your consent to these Terms.\n\nFor any Claim, you agree to first contact us at support@lawyerdesk.ai and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely event that we have not been able to resolve a Claim after sixty (60) days, we each agree to resolve any Claim through binding arbitration, except as provided herein. In the event of any conflict between the Rules and this Arbitration Agreement, the Arbitration Agreement shall control. The arbitration will be conducted in the jurisdiction of our choice unless you and we agree otherwise. If you are using the Services for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for paying any filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees in accordance with persisting rules, and the award rendered by the arbitrator will include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys' fees, and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses. If you are an individual using the Services for non-commercial purposes: (i) you may be required to pay a fee for the initiation of your case; (ii) the award rendered by the arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration, your reasonable attorney's fees, and your reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. You and we agree that the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve any disputes relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Arbitration Agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitrator shall also be responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to whether these Terms, or any provision of these Terms, is unconscionable or illusory or any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, unconscionability, or estoppel.\n\nNOTHING IN THIS SECTION WILL BE DEEMED AS: PREVENTING US FROM SEEKING INJUNCTIVE OR OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF FROM THE COURTS AS NECESSARY TO PREVENT THE ACTUAL OR THREATENED INFRINGEMENT, MISAPPROPRIATION, OR VIOLATION OF OUR DATA SECURITY, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OR OTHER PROPRIETARY RIGHTS.\n\nShould any part of this Arbitration Agreement be deemed void, unenforceable, or unlawful, whether in whole or in part, such portion shall be severed. The severance of any void, unenforceable, or unlawful provision, whether in whole or in part, shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining provisions of the Arbitration Agreement. The remaining provisions shall continue to be binding, and the parties' ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to the Arbitration Agreement shall remain intact. However, if the Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver is found to be void, unenforceable, or unlawful, in whole or in part, due to its potential obstruction of your ability to seek public injunctive relief, then any dispute concerning such relief (and only that relief) must be separated from arbitration and may be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction. Nonetheless, all other claims for relief subject to arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement shall proceed according to its terms. The parties agree that any litigation concerning entitlement to public injunctive relief shall be suspended until the resolution of individual claims in arbitration.\n\nH. Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver\nWITH REGARD TO ALL INDIVIDUALS AND ENTITIES, WHETHER THEY HAVE UTILIZED THE SERVICES FOR PERSONAL, COMMERCIAL, OR OTHER OBJECTIVES, ALL CLAIMS MUST BE PURSUED INDIVIDUALLY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY ALLEGED CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THIS WAIVER EXTENDS TO CLASS ARBITRATION, AND, UNLESS OTHERWISE AGREED UPON, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE CLAIMS FROM MULTIPLE INDIVIDUALS. BY ACCEPTING THESE TERMS, YOU AND LAWYER DESK ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU ARE EACH FORFEITING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY FORM OF CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.\n\nI. Copyright Notices\nWe respect content owner rights, and it is our policy to respond to alleged infringement notices that comply with the Copyright Act, 1999 of India.\n\nCopyright protection is bestowed upon original works of authorship that are preserved in a tangible medium of expression, encompassing literary, dramatic, musical, artistic, and specific other intellectual creations.
